# Brain-MRI-Classification

---

The Project builds a model that is trained on images of Brain MRI Scans, which it then uses to classify a test image into one of the following four categories : 

* Glioma
* Meningioma
* Pituitary Tumor
* No Tumor

> **Gliomas:** These are the tumors that occur in the brain and/or spinal cord. Types of glioma include: Astrocytomas, Ependymomas, and Oligodendrogliomas. Gliomas are one of the most common types of primary brain tumors. 
> **Meningiomas:** These are the tumors that arise from the Meninges — the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas grow very slowly, often over many years without causing symptoms. 
> **Pituitary tumors:** These are the tumors that form in the Pituitary — a small gland inside the skull. Most pituitary tumors are often pituitary adenomas, benign growths that do not spread beyond the skull.
